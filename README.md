# House Price Prediction - Regression Project

This project predicts **house prices** using Machine Learning techniques.  
The dataset contains housing features such as lot size, year built, number of rooms, location, etc.  
Models were trained and evaluated to predict the final sale price.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, outlier treatment, and feature engineering  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized data patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn  
3. **Modeling** – Applied Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
4. **Evaluation** – Compared models using R², RMSE, and MAE  
5. **Best Model** – Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy
